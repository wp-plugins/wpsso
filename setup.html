<p>The following is a short collection of suggestions and hints to get you
started with the WPSSO plugin. WPSSO works great <em>right-out-of-the-box</em>,
and you may decide to keep the default settings as-is, but modifying just a few
options for your website will really help to maximize your click-through
rate.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:numeric">

<li>
<p><strong>Create a Facebook Page, Twitter account, and Google+ account (or
Page) for your website / business</strong> (if you haven't already). You can
enter your website's social information on the WordPress Settings -&gt; Website
Social Accounts page. The social account values are used for Google / SEO,
Schema, Open Graph, and other meta tags, including the publisher (Organization)
social profiles markup in schema.org JSON-LD format. These social accounts may
also appear in Google Search results for your website / business.<p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Ask your authors to enter their Facebook, Google+, and Twitter
contact information</strong> on their user profile page. Each author's contact
information can appear in various meta tags and schema.org JSON-LD markup --
if/when they complete their user profile. All URLs found in the author's
contact methods will be listed in the author (Person) social profile markup.
The author's "Twitter @username" will be used to include a URL to their Twitter
profile as well.</p>

<p>Authors should also update their <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=followers">Facebook Follower
Settings</a> to enable a Follow button on their shared Facebook content.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Review the WordPress Settings -&gt; Image Dimensions values</strong>.</p>

<p>If your original images are large enough, you should set the Open Graph
Image Dimensions to 1200x1200px cropped or larger (see the option's help popup
for more information on Image Dimensions). Images that are at least 600px wide
will be displayed more prominently on Facebook, and 1200px is required to avoid
up-scaling images for retina / high PPI displays &mdash; so it's worth taking
the time to make sure that <em>all</em> your original / full-size featured
images are at least 1200px in width <em>and</em> height, along with setting an
Open Graph Image Dimension of 1200x1200px cropped.</p>

<p>The default Open Graph Image Dimensions settings are 600x600px cropped. You
can reduce these values down to 200x200px, but Facebook will display these
images as thumbnails on its timelines. The minimum recommended Image Dimensions
value is 600x600px cropped &mdash; for best results, use 1200px wide images or
larger.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Review all highlighted options</strong>.</p>

<p>The plugin will use information from the first post on index / archive and
search webpages. If you define a <em>Default Image ID</em> (or URL), the plugin
can use this image as a fallback in case a Post / Page does not contain a
suitable image, or force the default image on index / archive and/or search
webpages. See the SSO General -&gt; Images settings tab for these options and
others.</p>

<p>Other highlighted options that you may want to review include the
<em>Default Article Topic</em>, <em>Site Description</em>, <em>Facebook
Admin(s)</em>, and <em>Author Name Format</em>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Submit a few sample Posts and Pages to the <a
href="https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/">Facebook
Debugger</a></strong> to verify the accuracy of your Open Graph meta tags. A
link to the Facebook Debugger also available under the Validate tab in the
Social Settings metabox. Submitting a URL to the Facebook Debugger also clears
Facebook's cache (after clicking the "Fetch new scrape information" button a
few times), so the link under the Validate tab can be a useful resource.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Submit a Post / Page to the <a
href="http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/validator/">Pinterest Rich Pin
Validator</a></strong> and request approval for Rich Pins. Pinterest Rich Pins
are an extension of Open Graph meta tags, but the Rich Pin Validator can be a
little buggy, so double check any errors with the Facebook Debugger to make
sure they are actual / real errors.  Once approved, you can zoom a Pin to view
the Rich Pin information.</p>

<p><strong>Review the <a href="http://codex.wpsso.surniaulula.com/"
target="">plugin codex</a> on the support website</strong>. WPSSO is a powerful
tool, that can detect images and videos from a variety of sources (attached,
featured, content, etc.), along with e-commerce product information. It's worth
noting some of the most common questions, to get an idea of what it can do, and
some of the issues that may come up. Some of the most relevant / popular ones
