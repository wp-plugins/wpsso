== Description ==

**WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) is a fork of the excellent [NGFB Open Graph+](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) plugin - it has all the same great features, but strives to be a little smaller and lighter by removing the social sharing features (buttons, shortcodes, widgets, url shortening and rewriting)**.

WPSSO adds HTML meta tags (Open Graph, Pinterest Rich Pins, Twitter Cards) to the head section of WordPress webpages for improved Google Search results and sharing on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr and many more -- An absolute essential plugin for every WordPress website!

= Meta Tags =

WPSSO adds Facebook / [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and (optionally) [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). [See examples from Google Search / Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/extend/plugins/wpsso/screenshots/). 

**Twitter Cards**

WPSSO (Pro version) provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Twitter Cards, including configurable image sizes for each card type.

= Best Performance =

**WPSSO is fast and tuned for performance**, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching).

**WPSSO only loads the library files and object classes it needs**, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= 3rd Party Integration =

**Images and Videos**

WPSSO detects and uses all images, associated or included in your Post / Page content, embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (including video preview images). WPSSO supports WordPress Media Library galleries and [NextGEN Gallery v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries, shortcodes, image tags, preview images, etc. WordPress Media Library and NextGEN Gallery images are resized for optimal presentation in Open Graph (Facebook) meta tags, the many Twitter Card formats, and sharing on Pinterest.

**Enhanced SEO**

WPSSO (Pro version) integrates with [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), making sure your custom SEO settings are reflected in the Open Graph, Rich Pin, and Twitter Card meta tags.

**eCommerce Products**

WPSSO (Pro version) also supports [WooCommerce v1.x and v2.x](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), including variations and additional / custom images.

**Forums and Social**

WPSSO (Pro version) supports [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) (see the [BuddyPress Integration Notes](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/wpsso/notes/buddypress-integration/)), making sure your meta tags reflect the page content, including appropriate titles, descriptions, images, etc.

= Custom Contacts =

WPSSO (Pro version) allows you to customize the field names, label, and show / remove the following Contact Methods from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook 
* Google+ 
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn 
* Pinterest 
* Skype 
* Tumblr 
* Twitter 
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube

= Clean Uninstall =
