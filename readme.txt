== Description ==

**WordPress Social Sharing Optimization (WPSSO) is a fork of the excellent [NGFB Open Graph+](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-facebook/) plugin - it has all the same great features, but strives to be a little lighter and smaller by removing the social buttons and their related features (shortcodes, widgets, stylesheets, javascript caching, url shortening, and url rewriting)**.

= Summary of Features =

* Open Graph (Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, etc.), Rich Pin (Pinterest), and Twitter Card (Twitter) meta tags.
* Configurable image sizes and descriptions depending on context.
* Configurable contact fields for user profile pages.
* **Integrates with 3rd party plugins and services** for additional image, video, product, and content information:
  * NextGEN Gallery
  * JetPack Photon
  * WordPress SEO by Yoast
  * All in One SEO Pack
  * WooCommerce
  * MarketPress
  * WP e-Commerce
  * bbPress
  * BuddyPress
  * Youtube / Vimeo / Wistia APIs

= Complete Meta Tags =

WPSSO adds Facebook / [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/), [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), and (optionally) [Search Engine Optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) meta tags to the head section of webpages. These meta tags are used by Google Search and most social websites to describe and display your content correctly (title, description, keyword tags, images, videos, product, author profile / authorship, publisher, etc.). [See a few examples from Google Search / Google+, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and others](/extend/plugins/wpsso/screenshots/). 

WPSSO (Pro version) provides the [Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/summary-card), [Large Image Summary](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/large-image-summary-card), [Photo](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/photo-card), [Gallery](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/gallery-card), [Player](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/player-card) and [Product](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) Twitter Cards, including configurable image sizes for each card type.

= Best Performance =

**WPSSO is fast and tuned for performance**, and unlike most plugins, makes full use of all available caching techniques (persistent / non-persistent object and disk caching).

**WPSSO only loads the library files and object classes it needs**, keeping it small, fast, and yet still able to support a wide range of 3rd party integration features.

= 3rd Party Integration =

Aside from the additional support for Twitter Cards, the main difference between the GPL and Pro versions is the integration of 3rd party plugins and services.

**Images and Videos**

WPSSO detects and uses all images - associated or included in your Post or Page content - including WordPress Media Library image galleries and embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, and Wistia (including their preview images). WordPress Media Library images (and NextGEN Gallery in the Pro version) are resized and provided according to their intended audience (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, etc). 

WPSSO (Pro version) also includes support for [JetPack Photon](http://jetpack.me/support/photon/) and [NextGEN Gallery v1 and v2](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) albums, galleries and images (shortcodes, image tags, album / gallery preview images, etc.).

**Enhanced SEO**

WPSSO (Pro version) integrates with [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/), making sure your custom SEO settings are reflected in the Open Graph, Rich Pin, and Twitter Card meta tags.

**eCommerce Products**

WPSSO (Pro version) also supports [WooCommerce v1 and v2](http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), [MarketPress WordPress eCommerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-ecommerce/) and [WP e-Commerce](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-e-commerce/) product pages, creating appropriate meta tags for [Facebook Products](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/payments/product/), [Twitter Product Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/types/product-card) and [Pinterest Rich Pins](http://developers.pinterest.com/rich_pins/), including variations and additional / custom images.

**Forums and Social**

WPSSO (Pro version) supports [bbPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/bbpress/) and [BuddyPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) (see the [BuddyPress Integration Notes](http://surniaulula.com/codex/plugins/wpsso/notes/buddypress-integration/)), making sure your meta tags reflect the page content, including appropriate titles, descriptions, images, etc.

= Custom Contacts =

WPSSO (Pro version) allows you to customize the field names, label, and show / remove the following Contact Methods from the user profile page:

* AIM
* Facebook 
* Google+ 
* Jabber / Google Talk
* LinkedIn 
* Pinterest 
* Skype 
* Tumblr 
* Twitter 
* Yahoo IM
* YouTube

= Clean Uninstall =

**Try the WPSSO plugin with complete confidence** - when uninstalled, WPSSO removes *all* traces of itself from the database (options, site options, user and post meta, transients, etc.).

= Great Support =

**WPSSO support and development is on-going**. You can review the [FAQ](http://faq.wpsso.surniaulula.com/) and [Notes](http://notes.wpsso.surniaulula.com/) pages for additional setup information. If you have any suggestions or comments, post them to the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wpsso) or the [Pro version support website](http://support.wpsso.surniaulula.com/).

== Changelog ==

= Version 1.22.0 =

* Added the WPSSO_META_NAME_ALT, WPSSO_OPTIONS_NAME_ALT, WPSSO_SITE_OPTIONS_NAME_ALT constants to allow for settings migration.
* Added an WPSSO_TOPICS_LIST constant, with a default value of WPSSO_PLUGINDIR.'share/topics.txt'.
* Created a new `share/topics.txt` text file by merging the Wikipedia and StumbleUpon website lists.
* Expanded the "Website Topic" selection using the new `share/topics.txt` list.
* Moved the `sucom_get_lang()` function to `SucomUtil::get_lang()`.
* Moved the default options variable definition from lib/options.php to lib/config.php.
* Added an `sanitize_option_value()` method in the WpssoUtil class.
* Added an 'wpsso_option_type' filter to optimize sanitation of option values.

= Version 1.21.0 =

Please note that support for [the NextGEN Gallery plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/) has been moved to [the Pro version](http://surniaulula.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/) in v1.21.0. This restores balance between the two distributions - [the WPSSO GPL version from WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/) offers complete support for Open Graph+ meta tags and the WordPress Media Library (including its `gallery` shortcode), while the Pro version includes support for 3rd party plugins and services (like NextGEN Gallery, WordPress SEO, BuddyPress, bbPress, WooCommerce, Wistia videos, etc.). I remain committed to providing a complete and reliable set of features in the GPL version - all for free. There's no need to contribute in any way, though a little [help with forum questions](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wpsso), for example, is always welcome. ;-)

* **Moved the NextGEN Gallery support to a Pro version addon**.
* Added support for **JetPack Photon** to retrieve correct image sizes (Pro version).
* Added a 'wpsso_image_downsize' hook (for the Jetpack Photon Pro addon).
* Added hooks to disable JetPack Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags.
* Added a hook for the 'wpsso_sharing_url' filter to support WordPress SEO's "Force Transport" option (Pro version).
* Moved the URL rewriting and shortening methods into hooks for the 'wpsso_rewrite_url' and 'wpsso_shorten_url' filters (Pro version).
* Removed the "Disable Social Buttons" option from the SSO Custom Settings (Pro version).
* Added links to http URLs in the Open Graph+ Custom Settings 'Meta Tags Preview' tab.
* Changed the default object expiration time from 1800 to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
* Removed the "Reset Settings on Activate" Advanced option.
* Renamed the WPSSO_RESET constant to WPSSO_RESET_ON_ACTIVATE.
* Added an 'wpsso_load_lib' action to allow 3rd party plugins to provide library files.
* Moved several methods from lib/util.php to lib/com/util.php.
* Moved `show_sharing()` from lib/postmeta.php to lib/social.php.
* Renamed the 'WpssoPlugin' class to 'Wpsso'.
