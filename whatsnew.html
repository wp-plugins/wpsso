<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO v2.6</a></strong> provides a new 'Licenses' settings page to allow for future plugin extensions. Although most of the setting pages and features may not appear to have changed from v2.5.5, the underlying code - to support future plugin extensions - has undergone important revisions. The 'Network' multisite sub-menu has also been renamed 'Advanced', and provides a few more cache related options for Network sites / blogs.</p>

WPSSO v2.6.1 has been released to alongside a new <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-ssb/">WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (SSB) v1.0</a> extension plugin for WPSSO. As the name implies, WPSSO SSB works in conjunction with WPSSO, extending WPSSO's existing settings with additional pages, tabs, and options with social sharing button features.
