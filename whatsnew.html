<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO version
2.6</a></strong> provides a new 'Licenses' settings page to allow for future
plugin extensions. Although most of the setting pages and features may not
appear to have changed from v2.5.5, the underlying code - to support future
plugin extensions - has undergone important revisions. The 'Network' multisite
sub-menu has also been renamed 'Advanced', and provides a few more cache
related options for Network sites / blogs.</p>
