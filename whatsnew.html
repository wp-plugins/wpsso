<p><strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO version 2.6.x</a></strong> provides a new 'Licenses' settings page to allow for future plugin extensions. Although most of the setting pages and features may not appear to have changed from v2.5.5, the underlying code - to support future plugin extensions - has undergone important revisions. The 'Network' multisite sub-menu has also been renamed 'Advanced', and provides a few more cache related options for Network sites / blogs.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.6</strong> updates the wordpress.org URLs to HTTPS, adds a check for the number of returned video preview images, and includes a new 'Include Video Preview Image' option.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.6.1</strong> includes a small fix to allow the og:image meta tag to be disabled, without disabling the og:image:secure_url meta tag as well.</p>
