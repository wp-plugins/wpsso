<p><strong><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO version 2.6.9.1</a></strong> provides several new options.</p>

<p>A new 'Use Filtered (SEO) Titles' option allows the use of original title values in meta tags (by unchecking the option) instead of modified theme and/or SEO titles.</p>

<p>Two new 'Image URL Custom Field' and 'Video Embed HTML Custom Field' options have been added to the Advanced settings page, allowing you to fetch additional information from existing theme and/or 3rd-party plugin custom fields. These option custom field associations can be useful to reduce redundant entry fields on Post / Page editing pages.</p>

<p>A new 'Video Embed HTML' option has also been added to the Social Settings metabox, allowing you to paste complete video embed code instead of just a video URL.</p>

<p>Two new filters have also been added to allow finer-grain control over the addition / exclusion of the Social Settings metabox on specific post and/or use ID admin pages. A new constant is also available to manage the priority when saving post meta options (the default of 20 is after most other plugins have saved their post meta options).</p>

<p><strong>WPSSO version 2.6.9.2</strong> contains a small fix to escape special title separator values, and fixes the missing Google+ / Schema Description value on user profile pages.</p>
