<p><strong><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO version 2.6</a></strong> provides a new 'Licenses' settings page to allow for future plugin extensions. Although most of the setting pages and features may not appear to have changed from v2.5.5, the underlying code - to support future plugin extensions - has undergone important revisions. The 'Network' multisite sub-menu has also been renamed 'Advanced', and provides a few more cache related options for Network sites / blogs.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.1</strong> has been released to alongside a new <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-ssb/">WPSSO Social Sharing Buttons (SSB) v1.0</a> extension plugin for WPSSO. As the name implies, WPSSO SSB works in conjunction with WPSSO, extending WPSSO's existing settings with additional pages, tabs, and options with social sharing button features.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.2</strong> includes small updates to the settings help texts.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.2.1</strong> includes a fix for empty / missing Polylang post language, and adds support for the new pll_get_post_language() function (Pro version).</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.2.2</strong> fixes user ID detection on author index webpages, and improves the "Version Information" side metabox (now with information on extension plugins as well).
<a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wpsso-ssb/">WPSSO SSB version 1.0.4</a> has also been released to support the refactored code.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.2.3</strong> removes the welcome page display on installation/upgrade, and adds a CSS ID to the image dimension warnings.</p>

<p><strong>Version 2.6.2.4</strong> includes some minor code refactoring, and changes to some warning messages and option titles.
